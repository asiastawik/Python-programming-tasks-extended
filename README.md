# Python-programming-tasks-extended

## Project Overview
This repository contains Python functions that perform various operations such as calculating powers, processing lists of numbers, and working with Fibonacci sequences. The tasks are designed to practice input handling, list manipulations, and numerical computations.

## Task 1: Power Calculation
This function prompts the user to input a number, then returns the number raised to the power of 5.6. It handles both positive and negative numbers, returning the appropriate result for the power operation.

## Task 2: Count Greater Elements
This function, `count_greater(list_of_numbers, greater_than)`, takes two arguments: a list of numbers and a threshold value. It returns a tuple or list with two values:
- The count of numbers greater than the threshold.
- The sum of the numbers greater than the threshold.

## Task 3: Fibonacci Sequence Operations
This task involves working with the Fibonacci sequence. The following functions are implemented:

- **List Creation:** A list with the first two Fibonacci numbers, `[0, 1]`, is created.
- **`append_N_numbers(N)`:** This function appends the next `N` Fibonacci numbers to the list.
- **`get_sum()`:** This function calculates and returns the sum of all Fibonacci numbers in the list.
- **`get_Nth(N)`:** This function ensures that the list has at least `N` Fibonacci numbers and returns the `N`-th element (0-indexed).
- **`how_many_digits(N)`:** This function returns the number of digits in the result of `get_Nth(N)`.

These tasks provide a hands-on experience with user input, mathematical calculations, list processing, and recursive sequence generation.
